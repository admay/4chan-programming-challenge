Markov Chain Generator

This program generates a markov chain based on an input file.

A Markov Chain is a random process describing a sequence of possible events
where the probability of each event is based on the previous event.  They
can be used to generate sentences based on a sample text.

In simpler words, we are going to generate text that sounds like a human wrote
it. We will pick each word based off of the pervious two words and only words
that appeard after them in the input text. We can build smarter sounds chains
by basing off of 3 or more words, but we would need increasingly larger texts
to ensure that we will have sufficient options to pick from.
